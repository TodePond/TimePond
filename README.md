# TimePond
TimePond is a time-travel physics engine.<br>
It lets you play with time-travelling frogs!

**I made TimePond for this video about time travel: ðŸŒ€ [Top 9 ways to make Time Travel](https://youtu.be/Z24NKn6rQRY)**

My patrons voted for it at [patreon.com/todepond](https://patreon.com/todepond)

Most of the time-travel experiments are hidden behind URL parameters. Sorry about that!<br>
Here are some things you can try out though:

|  | Simple | Right | Fling | Fall | Bump |
